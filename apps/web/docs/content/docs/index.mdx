Welcome to Discraft!

## What is Discraft?

Discraft is a framework for building Discord bots. Think of it as a "batteries included" approach: it has built-in support for common features bots need out of the box. These include:

- File-based Application Command handling
- File-based event handling
- File-based cron-job scheduling
- Support for data persistence
- Built-in bot Webhook API
- Command, event, and API middleware

## Why Not Just Discord.js?

You might wonder why you should use Discraft instead of Discord.js. Discraft is actually built on top of Discord.js and aims to be very flexible, but it may be overkill for simple bots.
Below is a table to help you decide when you should use Discraft. If you're unsure, you can always [join our Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/dKeuR9yfBs) for help and support!
