# Discraft Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for Discraft, a modern, developer-friendly framework for building Discord bots with ease. Think of it as "Next.js for Discord bots" ‚Äî batteries included, ready to go.

## What is Discraft?

Discraft is a comprehensive framework designed to simplify the process of creating, developing, and deploying Discord bots. It provides a robust CLI, sensible conventions, and first-class support for modern workflows including traditional hosting, serverless deployments, and standalone executables.

### Key Features

- **Zero-config to start**: Get going with a single command
- **TypeScript-first**: Full TypeScript support out of the box
- **Hot reload/dev mode**: Iterate quickly with automatic reloading
- **Production builds**: Optimized output for fast, reliable bots
- **Serverless ready**: Deploy to Vercel in minutes
- **Standalone executables**: Package your bot as a self-contained binary

## Philosophy

Discraft is built on three core principles:

1. **Developer Experience First**: Commands and workflows are designed to be intuitive and efficient, reducing friction in the development process.

2. **Convention Over Configuration**: Sensible defaults and project structures let you focus on building features rather than configuring tools.

3. **Flexibility Without Complexity**: Advanced features are available when you need them, but they don't get in your way when you don't.
