# What is Discraft?

Welcome to Discraft!
Discraft is a modern, developer-friendly framework for building Discord bots with ease. Think of it as "Next.js for Discord bots" — batteries included, ready to go.

## Philosophy

Discraft is built for speed, simplicity, and flexibility. Whether you're prototyping or deploying at scale, Discraft gives you a powerful CLI, sensible conventions, and first-class support for modern workflows (including serverless and Vercel deploys).

- **Zero-config to start**: Get going with a single command.
- **TypeScript-first**: Full TS support out of the box.
- **Hot reload/dev mode**: Iterate quickly.
- **Production builds**: Optimized output for fast, reliable bots.
- **Serverless ready**: Deploy to Vercel in minutes.

## Quickstart

1. **Create a new project:**
   ```bash
   npx discraft init
   cd my-bot
   npx discraft dev
   ```
2. **Build for production:**
   ```bash
   npx discraft build
   npx discraft start
   ```
3. **Deploy to Vercel:**
   ```bash
   npx discraft vercel build
   # Push to your Vercel-connected repo
   ```

### AI Development

Discraft soon plans to have built-in MCP server options.
Discraft also has an [LLMs.txt](/llms.txt) file to give AI models information about Discraft when you are "vibe coding".

### Deploying to Vercel

Discraft supports seamless deployment to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for serverless Discord bots. Use `discraft vercel build` to generate API routes and bundle your bot for Vercel’s platform. See the [Deploying to Vercel guide](/docs/vercel-build) for full instructions and troubleshooting.
