Discraft's hot reloading system allows you to see changes to your bot in real-time during development, significantly speeding up the development process.

## Overview

Hot reloading (sometimes called "live reloading") is a development feature that automatically updates your bot when you make changes to your code, without requiring a full restart. This creates a rapid feedback loop that makes development much more efficient.

## How Hot Reloading Works in Discraft

When you run `discraft dev`, the following process occurs:

1. **Initial Build**: Discraft compiles your TypeScript code (if using TS)
2. **File Watching**: A file watcher is started to monitor changes to your project files
3. **Bot Startup**: Your Discord bot is started in development mode
4. **Change Detection**: When you modify a file, Discraft detects the change
5. **Incremental Rebuild**: Only the changed files are recompiled
6. **Bot Update**: The bot is updated with the new code without a full restart
7. **Command Re-registration**: If command definitions change, they're automatically re-registered with Discord

This process happens in seconds, allowing you to quickly iterate on your bot's features.

## What Gets Hot Reloaded

Discraft intelligently reloads different components of your bot:

### Commands

When you modify a command file:

- The command is recompiled
- The command definition is updated in Discord's API (if the structure changed)
- The command handler is updated in memory

Example: If you change the response message in your `ping.ts` command, the next time a user runs `/ping`, they'll see your updated message.

### Events

When you modify an event handler:

- The event handler is recompiled
- The old handler is removed
- The new handler is registered

Example: If you update your `messageCreate.ts` event to respond to different keywords, the changes will take effect for the next message received.

### Utility Files

When you modify utility files or other modules:

- The files are recompiled
- Any modules that import them will use the updated code

Example: If you update a helper function in your `utils/` directory, any command or event that uses that function will automatically use the new version.

## Development-Only Features

Hot reloading is specifically designed for development and includes several features that make debugging easier:

### Enhanced Logging

Development mode provides more detailed logs, including:

- Command registration status
- Event handler registration
- File change detection
- Error details with source locations

### Error Handling

When errors occur during development:

- Detailed error messages are displayed in the console
- The bot continues running when possible
- Stack traces show the exact location of errors

### Command Registration Optimization

During development:

- Commands are registered to a specific guild (server) for instant updates
- This bypasses Discord's global command registration delay (which can be up to an hour)
- You can set the development guild with the `DISCORD_GUILD_ID` environment variable

## Using Hot Reloading Effectively

### Starting Development Mode

```bash
npx discraft dev
```

This starts your bot with hot reloading enabled.

### Development Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with:

```
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_bot_token
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
DISCORD_GUILD_ID=your_development_server_id
```

The `DISCORD_GUILD_ID` is optional but recommended for faster command updates during development.

### Watching for Changes

Once development mode is running, you'll see output like:

```
[INFO] Starting Discraft in development mode...
[INFO] Watching for file changes...
[INFO] Bot is online and connected to Discord!
[INFO] Registered 5 commands to guild 123456789012345678
```

Now you can edit your files and see changes take effect immediately.

### Common Development Workflow

1. Start development mode: `npx discraft dev`
2. Edit a command or event file
3. Save the file
4. Test the changes in Discord
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until satisfied
6. Build for production when ready: `npx discraft build`

## Limitations and Edge Cases

While hot reloading covers most use cases, there are some limitations:

1. **Major Structural Changes**: Significant changes to your bot's structure might require a full restart
2. **External Dependencies**: Changes to external packages require a restart
3. **Environment Variables**: Changes to `.env` files require a restart
4. **Client Configuration**: Changes to Discord client configuration require a restart

In these cases, you'll need to stop and restart the development server.

## Troubleshooting

### Commands Not Updating

If your command changes aren't appearing:

- Ensure you've set `DISCORD_GUILD_ID` for development
- Check the console for registration errors
- Try restarting development mode

### Hot Reload Errors

If you see errors during hot reloading:

- Check for syntax errors in your code
- Ensure your file structure follows Discraft conventions
- Check for circular dependencies

### Slow Reloads

If reloads are taking too long:

- Check for large dependencies in your changed files
- Consider splitting large files into smaller modules
- Ensure you're not performing heavy operations on import
