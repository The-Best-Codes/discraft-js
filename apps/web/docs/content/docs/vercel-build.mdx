# `discraft vercel build`

Prepares your bot for deployment on Vercel by generating serverless API routes and bundling your code for Vercel’s platform.

For a full tutorial, see the [Deploy a Discord bot to Vercel Blog Post](https://bestcodes.dev/blog/how-to-deploy-a-discord-bot-to-vercel).

## Usage

```bash
# Using npx
npx discraft vercel build [options]

# Globally installed
discraft vercel build [options]
```

## Options

| Flag                      | Description                         | Default |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------- |
| `-b, --builder <builder>` | Builder to use: `esbuild` or `bun`. | auto    |

## What It Does

- Detects your main script (entry point).
- Generates command registry files for API routing.
- Optionally compiles and runs a register script to sync commands with Discord.
- Bundles your bot into Vercel’s `api/` directory for serverless deployment.

## Example

```bash
# Force Bun bundler
npx discraft vercel build -b bun
```

## Tips

- Use this for Vercel/serverless deployments (not needed for self-hosted bots).
- See the [Deploying to Vercel](/docs/vercel-build) section for full instructions and troubleshooting.
