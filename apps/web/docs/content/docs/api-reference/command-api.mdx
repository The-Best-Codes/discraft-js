description: Detailed reference for Discraft's Command API, including interfaces and methods for defining and interacting with commands.
---

Discraft's Command API provides a structured way to define, register, and handle Discord Slash Commands. It abstracts much of the complexity of raw Discord API interactions, allowing you to focus on your bot's logic.

Discraft commands are built on top of [Discord.js SlashCommandBuilder](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/builders/main/class/SlashCommandBuilder) for command definition and utilize the `Interaction` object for execution.

## `ICommand` Interface (Conceptual)

While not explicitly an exported TypeScript interface in a JavaScript project, Discraft commands conform to a specific structure. Conceptually, a command object should look like this:

```typescript
/dev/null/ICommand.ts#L1-6
interface ICommand {
  data: SlashCommandBuilder | Omit<SlashCommandBuilder, "addSubcommand" | "addSubcommandGroup">;
  execute: (interaction: CommandInteraction) => Promise<void> | void;
  // Optional: other properties like cooldown, permissions, etc.
}
```

### `data` Property

- **Type:** `SlashCommandBuilder` (from `discord.js/builders`)
- **Description:** This property defines the command's structure, including its name, description, and any options or subcommands it accepts. It uses the fluent API of `SlashCommandBuilder`.
- **Required:** Yes

#### Usage:

```javascript
/dev/null/command_data_examples.js#L1-30
const { SlashCommandBuilder } = require("discord.js");

// Basic command
const commandData = new SlashCommandBuilder()
  .setName("ping")
  .setDescription("Replies with Pong!");

// Command with options
const greetCommandData = new SlashCommandBuilder()
  .setName("greet")
  .setDescription("Greets a user.")
  .addUserOption(option =>
    option.setName("user")
      .setDescription("The user to greet")
      .setRequired(true)
  );

// Command with subcommands
const settingsCommandData = new SlashCommandBuilder()
  .setName("settings")
  .setDescription("Manage settings.")
  .addSubcommand(subcommand =>
    subcommand
      .setName("volume")
      .setDescription("Adjust volume.")
      .addIntegerOption(option =>
        option.setName("level")
          .setDescription("Volume level")
          .setRequired(true)
      )
  );
```

### `execute` Method

- **Type:** `(interaction: CommandInteraction) => Promise<void> | void`
- **Description:** This asynchronous function contains the core logic that runs when the command is invoked by a user. It receives a `CommandInteraction` object, which provides access to the command options, user, channel, and methods for replying.
- **Required:** Yes

#### Parameters:

- `interaction`: The `CommandInteraction` object representing the user's command invocation. Key properties and methods of `CommandInteraction` include:
  - `interaction.reply(options: string | MessagePayload | InteractionReplyOptions)`: Sends an initial response to the command. Can be a string, embed, or other message content. Use `{ ephemeral: true }` to make the reply visible only to the command invoker.
  - `interaction.deferReply(options?: InteractionDeferReplyOptions)`: Acknowledges the interaction and indicates that a response will follow. Useful for long-running tasks (over 3 seconds).
  - `interaction.editReply(options: string | MessagePayload | InteractionEditReplyOptions)`: Edits the initial reply, particularly after `deferReply()`.
  - `interaction.followUp(options: string | MessagePayload | InteractionReplyOptions)`: Sends an additional message after the initial reply.
  - `interaction.options`: An object providing methods to retrieve command option values (e.g., `getString()`, `getUser()`, `getInteger()`, `getSubcommand()`, `getSubcommandGroup()`).
  - `interaction.user`: The `User` object of the person who invoked the command.
  - `interaction.channel`: The `TextChannel` or `DMChannel` object where the command was invoked.

#### Usage:

```javascript
/dev/null/ping_command_api.js#L1-9
// In your command file (e.g., commands/ping.js)
const command = {
  data: new SlashCommandBuilder()
    .setName("ping")
    .setDescription("Replies with Pong!"),
  async execute(interaction) {
    await interaction.reply("Pong!");
  },
};

module.exports = command;
```

```javascript
/dev/null/greet_command_api.js#L1-19
// In your command file (e.g., commands/greet.js)
const { SlashCommandBuilder } = require("discord.js");

const command = {
  data: new SlashCommandBuilder()
    .setName("greet")
    .setDescription("Greets a specified user.")
    .addUserOption(option =>
      option.setName("user")
        .setDescription("The user to greet")
        .setRequired(true)
    ),
  async execute(interaction) {
    const user = interaction.options.getUser("user");
    await interaction.reply(`Hello, ${user.username}!`);
  },
};

module.exports = command;
```

```javascript
/dev/null/longtask_command_api.js#L1-17
// In a command with deferred reply (e.g., commands/longtask.js)
const { SlashCommandBuilder } = require("discord.js");

const command = {
  data: new SlashCommandBuilder()
    .setName("longtask")
    .setDescription("Performs a long-running task."),
  async execute(interaction) {
    await interaction.deferReply({ ephemeral: true }); // Acknowledge immediately

    // Simulate a long task
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 5000)); // 5-second delay

    await interaction.editReply("Task completed after 5 seconds!");
  },
};

module.exports = command;
```

## Command Loading and Registration

Discraft automatically discovers and loads command files from the `commands/` directory (or a path specified in your Discraft configuration). During the development process (`npm run dev`), commands are registered with Discord for immediate testing. In production builds, a separate step handles global command registration.

- **Location:** Command files are typically placed in `src/commands/` or `commands/` in your project root.
- **Export:** Each command file must `module.exports` (JavaScript) or `export default` (TypeScript) an object conforming to the `ICommand` structure.

## Error Handling

It is highly recommended to implement `try-catch` blocks within your `execute` methods to handle potential errors gracefully during command execution, providing informative feedback to the user.

```javascript
/dev/null/riskycommand_api.js#L1-26
// commands/riskycommand.js
const { SlashCommandBuilder } = require("discord.js");

const command = {
  data: new SlashCommandBuilder()
    .setName("risky")
    .setDescription("A command that might throw an error."),
  async execute(interaction) {
    try {
      // Simulate an operation that might fail
      if (Math.random() > 0.5) {
        throw new Error("Something unpredictable happened!");
      }
      await interaction.reply("Operation successful!");
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error in risky command:", error);
      await interaction.reply({
        content: "An error occurred while running this command. Please try again later.",
        ephemeral: true
      });
    }
  },
};

module.exports = command;
```
