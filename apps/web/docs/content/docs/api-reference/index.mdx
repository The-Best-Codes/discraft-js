description: Comprehensive documentation for Discraft's core APIs and structures.
---

This section provides detailed documentation for the various APIs and internal structures used within Discraft. Understanding these APIs will enable you to customize and extend your bot's functionality more effectively.

Discraft builds upon the powerful [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/) library, and this reference will cover how Discraft abstracts and enhances Discord.js components, as well as any Discraft-specific utilities and interfaces.

## API Categories

- [Command API](/docs/api-reference/command-api): Detailed reference for defining, handling, and interacting with Discord Slash Commands in Discraft.
- [Event API](/docs/api-reference/event-api): Information on how to register and manage event listeners for various Discord events.
- [Client API](/docs/api-reference/client-api): Documentation for the Discraft Discord client, including its initialization, properties, and methods.

## Key Concepts

Before diving into the specifics, it's helpful to understand a few core concepts:

- **Interactions:** In the context of Discord Slash Commands, an "interaction" represents the user's invocation of a command. The `interaction` object provides methods to reply, defer, and access command options.
- **Client:** The `Client` instance is the main hub for interacting with the Discord API. It manages connections, caches data, and emits events.
- **Collections:** Discord.js heavily uses `Collection` (an extended `Map`) for managing cached data like commands, guilds, and users. Discraft often stores its loaded commands in a `Collection`.

For in-depth understanding of underlying Discord.js structures (like `Guild`, `Channel`, `User`, `Message`, `EmbedBuilder`, etc.), please refer to the [official Discord.js documentation](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/discord.js/main/general/welcome).

## How to Use This Reference

Each API reference page will detail:

- **Overview:** A brief description of the API's purpose.
- **Classes/Objects:** Key classes or objects involved, their properties, and methods.
- **Usage Examples:** Code snippets demonstrating how to use the API.
- **Parameters:** Description of arguments for functions/methods.
- **Return Values:** What a function/method returns.

If you are looking for how to _implement_ features, start with the [Core Concepts](/docs/core-concepts) or [Advanced Topics](/docs/advanced-topics) sections. This API Reference is best used for understanding the specific technical details and available properties/methods once you know _what_ you want to build.
