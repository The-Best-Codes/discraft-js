# `discraft exec build`

Build a standalone executable of your Discraft bot (using Bun’s native compiler).

## Usage

```bash
npx discraft exec build --target <target> [options]
# or if installed globally
discraft exec build --target <target> [options]
```

## Options

| Flag                  | Description                                                                                         | Default             |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| `--target <target>`   | Required. Target platform. Supported: linux-x64, linux-arm64, windows-x64, darwin-x64, darwin-arm64 | —                   |
| `--entry <entry>`     | Custom entry point (relative to project root)                                                       | `dist/index.js`     |
| `--outfile <outfile>` | Output executable path (relative to root)                                                           | `dist/discraft-bot` |

## What It Does

- Uses Bun to compile your bot into a single executable file.
- Supports multiple platforms for easy distribution.
- Checks that your entry file exists and prepares output folders.

## Example

```bash
npx discraft exec build --target linux-x64
```

## Tips

- Make sure Bun is installed (`bun --version`).
- Place your `.env` file next to the executable for production.
- Run the executable from a terminal (not a GUI) to avoid issues.

> Note: Executable builds require Bun. Install from https://bun.sh
