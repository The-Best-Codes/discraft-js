# `discraft build`

Bundles and optimizes your bot for production use, generating build artifacts in `dist/`.

## Usage

```bash
npx discraft build [options]
# or if installed globally:
discraft build [options]
```

## Options

| Flag                | Description                                                 | Default |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `-b, --builder <b>` | Builder to use: `esbuild` or `bun`. Auto-detect if omitted. | auto    |

## What It Does

- Bundles your code and assets for production.
- Generates necessary registry files and copies configs/assets.
- Outputs everything to your `dist/` directory, ready for deployment or running in production.

## Example

```bash
# Use Bun as builder
npx discraft build -b bun
```

## Tips

- Use this before deploying or running `discraft start`.
- If you hit issues, try switching the builder (`-b esbuild` or `-b bun`).
