This guide covers the various ways to install and use Discraft for your Discord bot development.

## Installation Methods

There are several ways to use Discraft:

### Method 1: Using npx (Recommended)

The simplest way to use Discraft is through `npx`, which runs the package without installing it globally:

```bash
npx discraft <command>
```

For example:

```bash
npx discraft init
npx discraft dev
```

This approach ensures you're always using the latest version without manual updates.

### Method 2: Global Installation

If you prefer having Discraft available globally:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install -g discraft

# Using yarn
yarn global add discraft

# Using pnpm
pnpm add -g discraft

# Using bun
bun install -g discraft
```

After global installation, you can run commands directly:

```bash
discraft init
discraft dev
```

### Method 3: Local Project Installation

For version-controlled environments, you might want to install Discraft as a project dependency:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install discraft --save-dev

# Using yarn
yarn add discraft --dev

# Using pnpm
pnpm add discraft --save-dev

# Using bun
bun add discraft --dev
```

Then add scripts to your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "discraft dev",
    "build": "discraft build",
    "start": "discraft start"
  }
}
```

And run them with your package manager:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## System Requirements

- **Node.js**: v16.x or higher (v18.x+ recommended)
- **Package Manager**: npm, yarn, pnpm, or bun
- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, or Linux

## Verifying Installation

To verify that Discraft is installed correctly:

```bash
npx discraft --version
# or if installed globally
discraft --version
```

This should display the current version of Discraft.

## Setting Up a Discord Bot

Before you can start developing with Discraft, you'll need to create a Discord bot application:

1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Click "New Application" and give it a name
3. Navigate to the "Bot" tab and click "Add Bot"
4. Under the "TOKEN" section, click "Copy" to copy your bot token
5. Store this token securely - you'll need it for your bot's configuration

## Next Steps
