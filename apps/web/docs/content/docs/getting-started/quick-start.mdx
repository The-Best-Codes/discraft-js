# Quick Start Guide

This guide will walk you through creating, configuring, and running your first Discord bot with Discraft.

## Step 1: Create a New Project

Start by creating a new Discraft project:

```bash
npx discraft init
```

Follow the interactive prompts:

1. **Select a template**:
   - `TypeScript` (recommended)
   - `JavaScript`
   - `Vercel + TypeScript + Google AI` (for serverless deployments with AI capabilities)

2. **Choose a project location**:
   - Current directory
   - Custom directory (you'll be prompted for a name)

3. **Select a package manager**:
   - npm, yarn, pnpm, or bun
   - The CLI will detect and suggest your system's default

After completion, you'll have a fully scaffolded project with all necessary files and dependencies.

## Step 2: Configure Your Bot

1. **Set up environment variables**:

   Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and add your Discord bot token:

   ```
   DISCORD_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
   ```

   You can get this token from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

2. **Optional: Configure bot settings**:

   Open the Discord client file (e.g., `clients/discord.ts` or `clients/discord.js`) to customize bot settings like intents, presence, etc.

## Step 3: Start Development Mode

Launch your bot in development mode with hot reloading:

```bash
npx discraft dev
```

This will:
- Build your bot
- Start it in development mode
- Watch for file changes and automatically restart when you make updates

## Step 4: Create Your First Command

Let's create a simple "hello" command:

1. Create a new file in the `commands` directory:

   **TypeScript** (`commands/hello.ts`):
   ```typescript
   import { ChatInputCommandInteraction, SlashCommandBuilder } from "discord.js";

   export default {
     data: new SlashCommandBuilder()
       .setName("hello")
       .setDescription("Says hello to the user"),

     async execute(data: { interaction: ChatInputCommandInteraction }) {
       const { interaction } = data;
       const username = interaction.user.username;
       await interaction.reply(`Hello, ${username}! ðŸ‘‹`);
     },
   };
   ```

   **JavaScript** (`commands/hello.js`):
   ```javascript
   import { SlashCommandBuilder } from "discord.js";

   export default {
     data: new SlashCommandBuilder()
       .setName("hello")
       .setDescription("Says hello to the user"),

     async execute({ interaction }) {
       const username = interaction.user.username;
       await interaction.reply(`Hello, ${username}! ðŸ‘‹`);
     },
   };
   ```

2. **Save the file** - Discraft will automatically detect the new command, rebuild, and restart your bot.

## Step 5: Test Your Bot

1. **Invite your bot to a server**:
   - Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
   - Select your application
   - Go to OAuth2 > URL Generator
   - Select the `bot` and `applications.commands` scopes
   - Select appropriate bot permissions (e.g., "Send Messages")
   - Copy and open the generated URL to invite your bot

2. **Use your commands**:
   - In Discord, type `/hello` and press Enter
   - Your bot should respond with a greeting

## Step 6: Build for Production

When you're ready to deploy:

```bash
# Build the bot
npx discraft build

# Start in production mode
npx discraft start
```
