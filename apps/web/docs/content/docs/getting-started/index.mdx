# Getting Started with Discraft

Welcome to Discraft! This section will guide you through the process of setting up Discraft and creating your first Discord bot.

## Overview

Discraft is designed to make Discord bot development as smooth and efficient as possible. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, Discraft provides the tools you need to build powerful Discord bots with minimal setup.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

1. **Node.js**: Version 16.x or higher installed on your system
2. **npm**, **yarn**, **pnpm**, or **bun**: For package management
3. **Discord Developer Account**: To create bot tokens and applications

## Quick Start

The fastest way to get started with Discraft is to use the `init` command:

```bash
# Using npx (no installation required)
npx discraft init

# Or if you've installed discraft globally
discraft init
```

This interactive command will guide you through creating a new project, selecting a template, and installing dependencies.

## Next Steps

Once you've initialized your project, you can:

1. **Configure your bot**: Set up your Discord bot token and other environment variables
2. **Start development**: Run `npx discraft dev` to start the development server with hot reloading
3. **Create commands**: Add new commands in the `commands` directory
4. **Handle events**: Add event handlers in the `events` directory
