title: Serverless Deployment (Vercel)
description: Learn how to deploy your Discraft bot as serverless functions on Vercel.
---

This guide covers deploying your Discraft bot as serverless functions on Vercel, enabling a cost-effective, maintenance-free approach for Discord bots that primarily respond to interactions.

## Overview

Serverless deployment on Vercel offers several advantages:

- Zero server maintenance
- Auto-scaling based on usage
- Free tier for hobby projects
- Easy integration with Git repositories
- Built-in CI/CD pipeline

However, it's important to understand that serverless Discord bots have limitations:

- Cannot maintain persistent connections to Discord
- Limited to responding to interactions (slash commands, buttons, etc.)
- Cannot listen for events like message creation or reactions
- Functions have execution time limits

## Prerequisites

Before deploying to Vercel, you'll need:

1. A [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/signup)
2. A Discord bot application with slash commands
3. The Vercel CLI installed (`npm i -g vercel`)
4. A Discraft project using the Vercel template (or adapted for serverless)

## Creating a Vercel-Compatible Bot

The easiest way to create a Vercel-compatible bot is to use the Discraft Vercel template:

```bash
# Create a new project with the Vercel template
discraft init
# Select "Vercel + TypeScript + Google AI" when prompted
```

If you have an existing project, you'll need to adapt it for serverless deployment:

1. Create a Vercel configuration file (`vercel.json`):

   ```json
   {
     "version": 2,
     "builds": [{ "src": "index.ts", "use": "@vercel/node" }],
     "routes": [{ "src": "/(.*)", "dest": "index.ts" }]
   }
   ```

2. Update your bot's entry point to handle HTTP requests:

   ```typescript
   import {
     InteractionType,
     InteractionResponseType,
   } from "discord-interactions";
   import { verifyKey } from "discord-interactions";

   export default async function handler(req, res) {
     // Verify the request is from Discord
     const signature = req.headers["x-signature-ed25519"];
     const timestamp = req.headers["x-signature-timestamp"];
     const isValidRequest = verifyKey(
       JSON.stringify(req.body),
       signature,
       timestamp,
       process.env.DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY
     );

     if (!isValidRequest) {
       return res.status(401).send("Bad request signature");
     }

     // Handle the interaction
     const interaction = req.body;

     if (interaction.type === InteractionType.PING) {
       return res.send({
         type: InteractionResponseType.PONG,
       });
     }

     if (interaction.type === InteractionType.APPLICATION_COMMAND) {
       // Handle commands here
       const { name } = interaction.data;

       if (name === "ping") {
         return res.send({
           type: InteractionResponseType.CHANNEL_MESSAGE_WITH_SOURCE,
           data: {
             content: "Pong!",
           },
         });
       }
     }

     return res.status(400).send("Unknown interaction type");
   }
   ```

## Building for Vercel

Discraft provides a specialized build command for Vercel deployments:

```bash
# Build your bot for Vercel deployment
discraft vercel build
```

This command:

1. Compiles your TypeScript code
2. Optimizes the build for serverless deployment
3. Creates the necessary API routes
4. Prepares the project for Vercel deployment

## Deploying to Vercel

### Option 1: Using the Vercel CLI

1. Build your project:

   ```bash
   discraft vercel build
   ```

2. Deploy to Vercel:

   ```bash
   vercel
   ```

3. Follow the prompts to link your project to a Vercel project

### Option 2: Connecting to a Git Repository

1. Push your code to GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket
2. Log in to your [Vercel dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
3. Click "Add New" > "Project"
4. Select your repository
5. Configure your project settings:
   - Framework Preset: Other
   - Build Command: `npm run build` or `discraft vercel build`
   - Output Directory: `.vercel/output`
6. Add environment variables (see below)
7. Click "Deploy"

## Environment Variables

For your bot to function correctly, you need to set these environment variables in your Vercel project settings:

```
# From Discord Developer Portal
DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY=your_discord_public_key
DISCORD_APP_ID=your_discord_app_id
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token

# Any other API keys your bot needs
```

To add environment variables:

1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Navigate to "Settings" > "Environment Variables"
3. Add each variable and its value
4. Redeploy your project for the changes to take effect

## Configuring Discord Interactions Endpoint

After deploying, you need to tell Discord where to send interactions:

1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Select your application
3. Navigate to "General Information"
4. Set the "Interactions Endpoint URL" to your Vercel deployment URL + `/api`
   - Example: `https://my-discraft-bot.vercel.app/api`
5. Discord will send a test interaction to verify the endpoint works

## Registering Slash Commands

To register slash commands for your bot:

```bash
# Using the built-in script in the Vercel template
npm run register

# Or manually with the Discord API
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bot YOUR_BOT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "ping",
    "description": "Replies with Pong!",
    "type": 1
  }' \
  https://discord.com/api/v10/applications/YOUR_APP_ID/commands
```

## Handling Longer Operations

Vercel functions have execution time limits (10-60 seconds depending on your plan). For operations that might take longer:

1. Acknowledge the interaction immediately:

   ```typescript
   // Acknowledge the interaction
   res.send({
     type: InteractionResponseType.DEFERRED_CHANNEL_MESSAGE_WITH_SOURCE,
   });

   // Then use the followup URL to send the actual response
   const followupUrl = `https://discord.com/api/v10/webhooks/${interaction.application_id}/${interaction.token}/messages/@original`;

   // Process your longer operation
   const result = await longRunningOperation();

   // Send the result
   await fetch(followupUrl, {
     method: "PATCH",
     headers: {
       "Content-Type": "application/json",
     },
     body: JSON.stringify({
       content: result,
     }),
   });
   ```

## Monitoring and Logs

To monitor your serverless bot:

1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Navigate to "Deployments" to see all deployments
3. Click on a deployment to view details
4. Click "Functions" to see function metrics
5. Click "Logs" to view execution logs

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Discord reports invalid interactions endpoint**

   - Verify your endpoint URL is correct
   - Check that your `DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY` is set correctly
   - Ensure your verification logic is working

2. **Commands not appearing in Discord**

   - Verify command registration was successful
   - Check that your bot has the `applications.commands` scope
   - Try re-inviting the bot to your server

3. **Function execution timeout**

   - Implement the deferred response pattern shown above
   - Optimize your code for faster execution
   - Consider upgrading your Vercel plan for longer timeouts

4. **Environment variables not working**
   - Verify variables are set in Vercel dashboard
   - Redeploy after adding/changing variables
   - Check for typos in variable names
