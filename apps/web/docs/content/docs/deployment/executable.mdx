# Standalone Executable

This guide covers packaging your Discraft bot as a standalone executable, allowing for easy distribution and deployment without requiring Node.js or other dependencies.

## Overview

Creating a standalone executable of your bot offers several advantages:
- Distribution to users without technical knowledge
- No need to install Node.js or npm on the target system
- Simplified installation and setup process
- Protection of your source code
- Consistent runtime environment

## Prerequisites

Before creating an executable, you'll need:

1. A working Discraft bot project
2. Your bot built for production (`discraft build`)
3. Discraft CLI installed (`npm install -g @discraft/cli`)

## Building an Executable

Discraft provides a specialized command for creating executables:

```bash
discraft exec build --target <target-platform>
```

### Supported Platforms

The `--target` parameter specifies which platform to build for:

| Target | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `linux-x64` | 64-bit Linux (most common Linux distributions) |
| `linux-arm64` | ARM64 Linux (Raspberry Pi 4, AWS Graviton, etc.) |
| `windows-x64` | 64-bit Windows |
| `darwin-x64` | 64-bit macOS (Intel) |
| `darwin-arm64` | ARM64 macOS (Apple Silicon M1/M2/M3) |

### Example

```bash
# Build for 64-bit Windows
discraft exec build --target windows-x64

# Build for Apple Silicon Mac
discraft exec build --target darwin-arm64
```

### Additional Options

The `exec build` command supports additional options:

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `--entry <path>` | Custom entry point | `dist/index.js` |
| `--outfile <path>` | Output file name | `dist/discraft-bot` |

Example with custom options:
```bash
discraft exec build --target linux-x64 --entry src/main.js --outfile my-bot
```

## How It Works

The executable build process:

1. Bundles your code and all dependencies into a single JavaScript file
2. Packages this file with a Node.js runtime
3. Creates a platform-specific executable that runs your bot

The resulting executable is completely self-contained and doesn't require Node.js to be installed on the target system.

## Best Practices

### Environment Variables

For production deployments, sensitive information should be loaded from environment variables rather than being hardcoded:

```typescript
// Load token from environment variable
const token = process.env.DISCORD_TOKEN;
if (!token) {
  console.error('DISCORD_TOKEN environment variable is required');
  process.exit(1);
}
```

You can create a wrapper script or documentation to explain how to set these variables.

### File System Access

Remember that executables have different working directories than development environments:

```typescript
// Use __dirname to reference files relative to your code
import path from 'path';
const configPath = path.join(__dirname, 'config.json');
```

### Cross-Platform Compatibility

If you're distributing to multiple platforms, ensure your code is cross-platform compatible:

```typescript
// Use path.join for cross-platform path handling
import path from 'path';
const logPath = path.join(process.cwd(), 'logs', 'bot.log');

// Use cross-platform line endings
const content = 'Line 1\n' + 'Line 2';
```

## Distribution

### Windows (.exe)

For Windows users:

1. Distribute the `.exe` file
2. Create a batch file to set environment variables:
   ```batch
   @echo off
   set DISCORD_TOKEN=your_token_here
   start discraft-bot.exe
   ```

### Linux/macOS

For Linux/macOS users:

1. Distribute the executable file
2. Make it executable: `chmod +x discraft-bot`
3. Create a shell script to set environment variables:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   export DISCORD_TOKEN=your_token_here
   ./discraft-bot
   ```

## Running as a Service

### Windows Service

To run your bot as a Windows service:

1. Install [NSSM (Non-Sucking Service Manager)](https://nssm.cc/)
2. Open Command Prompt as Administrator
3. Run:
   ```batch
   nssm install DiscraftBot "C:\path\to\your\discraft-bot.exe"
   nssm set DiscraftBot AppEnvironmentExtra "DISCORD_TOKEN=your_token_here"
   nssm start DiscraftBot
   ```

### Linux Systemd Service

To run your bot as a systemd service on Linux:

1. Create a service file at `/etc/systemd/system/discraft-bot.service`:
   ```ini
   [Unit]
   Description=Discraft Discord Bot
   After=network.target

   [Service]
   ExecStart=/path/to/discraft-bot
   Restart=always
   User=youruser
   Environment=DISCORD_TOKEN=your_token_here

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

2. Enable and start the service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable discraft-bot
   sudo systemctl start discraft-bot
   ```

### macOS Launch Daemon

To run your bot as a launch daemon on macOS:

1. Create a plist file at `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.discraft.bot.plist`:
   ```xml
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
   <plist version="1.0">
   <dict>
       <key>Label</key>
       <string>com.discraft.bot</string>
       <key>ProgramArguments</key>
       <array>
           <string>/path/to/discraft-bot</string>
       </array>
       <key>EnvironmentVariables</key>
       <dict>
           <key>DISCORD_TOKEN</key>
           <string>your_token_here</string>
       </dict>
       <key>RunAtLoad</key>
       <true/>
       <key>KeepAlive</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   </plist>
   ```

2. Load the launch agent:
   ```bash
   launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.discraft.bot.plist
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Permission denied" error on Linux/macOS**
   - Make the file executable: `chmod +x discraft-bot`

2. **Missing environment variables**
   - Ensure environment variables are set before running the executable
   - Check for typos in variable names

3. **Antivirus flagging the executable**
   - This can happen with packaged executables
   - Add an exception in your antivirus software
   - Consider code signing for production applications

4. **File path issues**
   - Use absolute paths or paths relative to the executable
   - Avoid hardcoded paths that might not exist on the target system

## Limitations

- Executable size is larger than the source code (typically 50-100MB)
- Native modules might require special handling
- Updates require distributing a new executable
