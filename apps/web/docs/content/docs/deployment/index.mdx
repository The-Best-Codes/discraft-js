# Deployment

This section covers the different methods for deploying your Discraft bot to production environments. Discraft supports multiple deployment strategies to fit various use cases and hosting environments.

## Overview

Deploying a Discord bot involves making it available 24/7 with reliable hosting, proper error handling, and efficient resource usage. Discraft provides tools and optimizations for several deployment scenarios.

## Deployment Options

Discraft supports three main deployment strategies:

1. **[Traditional Deployment](/docs/deployment/traditional)**: Running your bot on a server or VPS
2. **[Serverless Deployment (Vercel)](/docs/deployment/vercel)**: Deploying as serverless functions
3. **[Standalone Executable](/docs/deployment/executable)**: Packaging as a self-contained executable

Each approach has its own advantages and trade-offs:

| Deployment Type | Pros | Cons | Best For |
|-----------------|------|------|----------|
| Traditional | Full feature support, persistent connection | Requires server management | Feature-rich bots, event listeners |
| Serverless | Low cost, auto-scaling, zero maintenance | Limited to interactions, no persistent connection | Simple command bots, AI integrations |
| Executable | Easy distribution, no Node.js required | Larger file size, manual updates | Distribution to non-technical users |

## Choosing a Deployment Strategy

Consider these factors when choosing a deployment strategy:

### Traditional Deployment

Choose traditional deployment if your bot:
- Needs to listen for events (messages, reactions, etc.)
- Maintains state between interactions
- Performs background tasks or scheduled operations
- Requires persistent connections to external services

### Serverless Deployment

Choose serverless deployment if your bot:
- Primarily responds to slash commands
- Doesn't need to listen for events
- Has minimal state requirements
- Benefits from auto-scaling and zero maintenance

### Executable Deployment

Choose executable deployment if your bot:
- Needs to be distributed to users without technical knowledge
- Runs in environments without Node.js
- Benefits from simplified installation
- Needs to run as a desktop application

## General Deployment Considerations

Regardless of your deployment strategy, consider these best practices:

### Environment Variables

Store sensitive information like tokens in environment variables, not in your code:

```
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_bot_token
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
```

### Error Handling

Implement robust error handling to prevent crashes:

```typescript
try {
  // Bot operations
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Error:", error);
  // Recovery logic
}
```

### Logging

Set up appropriate logging for production:

```typescript
// Production-friendly logging
const logger = {
  error: (msg) => console.error(`[ERROR] ${msg}`),
  warn: (msg) => console.warn(`[WARN] ${msg}`),
  info: (msg) => console.info(`[INFO] ${msg}`),
  // Only log debug in development
  debug: (msg) => process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production" && console.debug(`[DEBUG] ${msg}`)
};
```

### Monitoring

Consider setting up monitoring for your bot:
- Health checks
- Performance metrics
- Error alerts
- Usage statistics

### Scaling

Plan for scaling as your bot grows:
- Database connections
- API rate limits
- Memory usage
- CPU utilization
