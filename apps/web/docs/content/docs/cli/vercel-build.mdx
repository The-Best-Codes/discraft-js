# vercel-build Command

The `discraft vercel-build` command prepares your Discord bot for deployment on Vercel's serverless platform, optimizing it for webhook-based interactions.

## Overview

Vercel deployment is ideal for Discord bots that primarily respond to interactions (slash commands) rather than needing to maintain a persistent connection. The `vercel-build` command:

- Compiles your code for serverless deployment
- Configures webhook endpoints for Discord interactions
- Optimizes for Vercel's serverless environment
- Creates the necessary configuration files

## Basic Usage

```bash
npx discraft vercel-build
```

This builds your bot for Vercel deployment.

## Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--out-dir`, `-o` | Specify the output directory |
| `--source-maps`, `-s` | Generate source maps |
| `--minify`, `-m` | Minify the output code |
| `--clean`, `-c` | Clean the output directory before building |
| `--help`, `-h` | Display help information |

## Prerequisites

Before using `vercel-build`, you should:

1. Have a Vercel account
2. Install the Vercel CLI (optional, for local testing)
3. Use the `vercel-ts-ai` template or adapt your project for serverless deployment

## How Serverless Discord Bots Work

Unlike traditional Discord bots that maintain a persistent WebSocket connection, serverless bots:

1. Receive interactions via webhooks
2. Process the interaction in a serverless function
3. Respond within the 3-second window required by Discord
4. Use deferred responses and followups for longer operations

## Vercel Configuration

The `vercel-build` command generates or updates these files:

1. **`vercel.json`**: Configuration for Vercel deployment
   ```json
   {
     "version": 2,
     "builds": [
       { "src": "index.ts", "use": "@vercel/node" }
     ],
     "routes": [
       { "src": "/(.*)", "dest": "index.ts" }
     ]
   }
   ```

2. **`.vercelignore`**: Files to exclude from deployment
   ```
   node_modules
   .env
   .env.*
   ```

## Discord Configuration

For your bot to work with Vercel, you need to configure Discord to send interactions to your Vercel deployment:

1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Select your application
3. Go to "General Information"
4. Set the "Interactions Endpoint URL" to your Vercel deployment URL + `/api/interactions`
   - Example: `https://my-discord-bot.vercel.app/api/interactions`

## Examples

### Basic Vercel Build

```bash
npx discraft vercel-build
```

### Specify Output Directory

```bash
npx discraft vercel-build --out-dir ./vercel-build
```

### Generate Source Maps

```bash
npx discraft vercel-build --source-maps
```

### Minify Output

```bash
npx discraft vercel-build --minify
```

## Deployment Process

After building your bot for Vercel:

1. **Push to GitHub**: Push your code to a GitHub repository

2. **Connect to Vercel**: 
   - Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
   - Create a new project
   - Import your GitHub repository
   - Configure environment variables (DISCORD_TOKEN, DISCORD_CLIENT_ID, etc.)
   - Deploy

3. **Configure Discord Webhook**:
   - Copy your Vercel deployment URL
   - Set it as the Interactions Endpoint URL in the Discord Developer Portal

## Environment Variables

Set these environment variables in your Vercel project settings:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `DISCORD_TOKEN` | Your Discord bot token |
| `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID` | Your Discord application client ID |
| `DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY` | Your Discord application public key (for webhook verification) |

## Command Registration

For serverless bots, commands need to be registered separately. The `vercel-ts-ai` template includes a registration script:

```bash
# Register commands (run locally or in a CI/CD pipeline)
npx tsx scripts/register.ts
```

## Limitations of Serverless Bots

Serverless Discord bots have some limitations:

1. **No persistent connection**: Cannot listen for events like messages, reactions, etc.
2. **Cold starts**: Initial responses may be slower due to serverless cold starts
3. **Timeout constraints**: Must respond to interactions within 3 seconds
4. **Statelessness**: No built-in state between interactions

## Best Practices for Serverless Bots

1. **Use deferred responses**: For operations that take longer than 3 seconds
   ```typescript
   await interaction.deferReply();
   // Long operation...
   await interaction.editReply("Result");
   ```

2. **Optimize for cold starts**: Keep dependencies minimal

3. **Use external state**: Store state in databases or key-value stores

4. **Implement webhook verification**: Verify that requests come from Discord

## Testing Locally

You can test your Vercel deployment locally:

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Run locally
vercel dev
```

Use a tool like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to expose your local server to the internet for testing with Discord.
