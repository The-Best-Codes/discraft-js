# build Command

The `discraft build` command compiles your Discord bot for production deployment, optimizing it for performance and reliability.

## Overview

The build process:
- Compiles TypeScript to JavaScript (if using TypeScript)
- Optimizes code for production
- Generates command and event registries
- Creates a production-ready output in the `dist/` directory

## Basic Usage

```bash
npx discraft build
```

This builds your bot for production deployment.

## Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--out-dir`, `-o` | Specify the output directory |
| `--source-maps`, `-s` | Generate source maps |
| `--minify`, `-m` | Minify the output code |
| `--clean`, `-c` | Clean the output directory before building |
| `--help`, `-h` | Display help information |

## Environment Variables

The `build` command uses these environment variables:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `NODE_ENV` | Node environment | Set to `"production"` during build |

## Build Process

When you run `discraft build`, the following steps occur:

1. **Preparation**:
   - The output directory is created (or cleaned if using `--clean`)
   - Environment is set to production

2. **Compilation**:
   - TypeScript files are compiled to JavaScript (if using TypeScript)
   - JavaScript files are processed and optimized

3. **Command Processing**:
   - Command files are discovered
   - A command registry is generated

4. **Event Processing**:
   - Event handlers are discovered
   - An event registry is generated

5. **Optimization**:
   - Code is optimized for production
   - Unused code is removed (tree-shaking)
   - Code is minified (if using `--minify`)

6. **Output**:
   - Compiled files are written to the output directory
   - Source maps are generated (if using `--source-maps`)

## Output Structure

After building, your output directory (default: `dist/`) will contain:

```
dist/
├── clients/          # Compiled client files
├── commands/         # Compiled command files
├── events/           # Compiled event handlers
├── utils/            # Compiled utility functions
├── .discraft/        # Generated registries
└── index.js          # Main entry point
```

## Examples

### Basic Build

```bash
npx discraft build
```

### Specify Output Directory

```bash
npx discraft build --out-dir ./build
```

### Generate Source Maps

```bash
npx discraft build --source-maps
```

### Minify Output

```bash
npx discraft build --minify
```

### Clean Output Directory

```bash
npx discraft build --clean
```

### Combine Multiple Options

```bash
npx discraft build --out-dir ./build --source-maps --minify --clean
```

## Production Optimizations

The build process includes several optimizations for production:

1. **Command Registration**: Commands are set up for global registration
2. **Error Handling**: Production-appropriate error handling is implemented
3. **Performance**: Code is optimized for performance
4. **Size**: Unused code is removed to reduce bundle size
5. **Stability**: Development-only code is excluded

## Command Registration in Production

In production builds, commands are configured for global registration by default. This means:

- Commands are registered to all servers where your bot is present
- Command updates may take up to an hour to propagate (Discord API limitation)
- The registration process is optimized for stability

## Running the Built Bot

After building, you can run your bot with:

```bash
node dist/index.js
```

Or using the `discraft start` command:

```bash
npx discraft start
```

## Environment Configuration

For production deployment, create a `.env.production` file with your production environment variables:

```
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_production_bot_token
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=your_production_client_id
```

## Troubleshooting

### Build Errors

If you encounter build errors:

```bash
# Check for TypeScript errors
npx tsc --noEmit

# Try with verbose logging
npx discraft build --verbose
```

### Missing Dependencies

If you're missing dependencies in the build:

```bash
# Ensure dependencies are correctly listed in package.json
npm install

# Rebuild
npx discraft build
```

### Large Build Size

If your build is unexpectedly large:

```bash
# Use minification
npx discraft build --minify

# Check for large dependencies that could be externalized
```
