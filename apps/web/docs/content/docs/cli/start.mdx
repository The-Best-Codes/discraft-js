---

The `discraft start` command runs your Discord bot in production mode, using the optimized build created by the `build` command.

## Overview

The `start` command is designed for running your bot in production environments. It:

- Loads the compiled code from the build directory
- Sets the environment to production
- Optimizes for stability and performance
- Handles errors appropriately for production

## Basic Usage

```bash
npx discraft start
```

This starts your bot in production mode.

## Options

| Option              | Description                                               |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--dir`, `-d`       | Specify the directory containing the built code           |
| `--log-level`, `-l` | Set the logging level (error, warn, info, verbose, debug) |
| `--help`, `-h`      | Display help information                                  |

## Environment Variables

The `start` command uses these environment variables:

| Variable            | Description                        | Default               |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| `DISCORD_TOKEN`     | Your Discord bot token             | Required              |
| `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID` | Your Discord application client ID | Required              |
| `NODE_ENV`          | Node environment                   | Set to `"production"` |

## Production Mode

When running in production mode:

1. **Performance Optimizations**: The bot runs with optimized settings for performance
2. **Error Handling**: Errors are handled gracefully to prevent crashes
3. **Logging**: Logging is configured for production (less verbose)
4. **Command Registration**: Commands are registered globally (to all servers)

## Prerequisites

Before running `discraft start`, you must build your bot:

```bash
npx discraft build
```

This creates the optimized code that the `start` command will run.

## Examples

### Basic Start

```bash
npx discraft start
```

### Specify Build Directory

```bash
npx discraft start --dir ./build
```

### Set Logging Level

```bash
npx discraft start --log-level warn
```

## Running in Production Environments

For production deployments, you should:

1. **Set up environment variables**:

   - Use a `.env.production` file or environment variables in your hosting platform
   - Ensure `DISCORD_TOKEN` and `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID` are set

2. **Build the bot**:

   ```bash
   npx discraft build
   ```

3. **Start the bot**:
   ```bash
   npx discraft start
   ```

## Process Management

In production, you should use a process manager to keep your bot running and handle restarts:

### Using PM2

```bash
# Install PM2
npm install -g pm2

# Start your bot with PM2
pm2 start "npx discraft start" --name "discord-bot"

# Set up auto-restart
pm2 startup
pm2 save
```

### Using Docker

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

COPY . .
RUN npx discraft build

CMD ["npx", "discraft", "start"]
```

## Logging in Production

Production logging is less verbose by default. You can control the log level:

```bash
# Minimal logging (errors only)
npx discraft start --log-level error

# Standard logging (errors and warnings)
npx discraft start --log-level warn

# Informational logging
npx discraft start --log-level info
```

## Error Handling

In production mode, errors are handled to prevent the bot from crashing:

- Unhandled exceptions are caught and logged
- Command errors are isolated to prevent affecting other commands
- Connection issues trigger automatic reconnection attempts

## Monitoring

For production deployments, consider setting up monitoring:

1. **Health checks**: Implement a simple HTTP server for health checks
2. **Metrics**: Track command usage, errors, and performance
3. **Alerts**: Set up notifications for critical errors

## Troubleshooting

### Bot Not Starting

If your bot doesn't start:

```bash
# Check if the build exists
ls -la dist/

# Try rebuilding
npx discraft build

# Start with verbose logging
NODE_DEBUG=* npx discraft start
```

### Command Registration Issues

If commands aren't registering:

```bash
# Verify your client ID is correct
echo $DISCORD_CLIENT_ID

# Rebuild and restart
npx discraft build
npx discraft start
```

### Memory Issues

If your bot is using too much memory:

```bash
# Limit Node.js memory usage
NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=512" npx discraft start
```
