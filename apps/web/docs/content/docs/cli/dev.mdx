# dev Command

The `discraft dev` command runs your Discord bot in development mode with hot reloading, allowing you to see changes in real-time as you edit your code.

## Overview

Development mode is designed to provide a smooth development experience with:
- Hot reloading when files change
- Automatic command registration
- Enhanced error reporting
- Development-specific optimizations

## Basic Usage

```bash
npx discraft dev
```

This starts your bot in development mode and watches for file changes.

## Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--port`, `-p` | Specify the port for the development server |
| `--no-watch` | Disable file watching and hot reloading |
| `--watch-dir`, `-w` | Specify additional directories to watch |
| `--verbose`, `-v` | Enable verbose logging |
| `--help`, `-h` | Display help information |

## Environment Variables

The `dev` command uses these environment variables:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `DISCORD_TOKEN` | Your Discord bot token | Required |
| `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID` | Your Discord application client ID | Required |
| `DISCORD_GUILD_ID` | Development server ID for testing | Optional |
| `NODE_ENV` | Node environment | `"development"` |

## Development Server

When you run `discraft dev`, a development server starts that:

1. Compiles your TypeScript code (if using TypeScript)
2. Starts your Discord bot
3. Watches for file changes
4. Recompiles and updates the bot when files change

## Command Registration

In development mode, commands are registered to a specific guild (server) for instant updates. This bypasses Discord's global command registration delay, which can be up to an hour.

To enable this feature, set the `DISCORD_GUILD_ID` environment variable in your `.env` file:

```
DISCORD_GUILD_ID=your_development_server_id
```

## Hot Reloading

Hot reloading automatically updates your bot when you make changes to your code. This includes:

- Command files
- Event handlers
- Utility functions
- Other modules

For more details on how hot reloading works, see the [Hot Reloading](/docs/core-concepts/hot-reloading) guide.

## Examples

### Basic Development Mode

```bash
npx discraft dev
```

### Specify a Port

```bash
npx discraft dev --port 3001
```

### Disable File Watching

```bash
npx discraft dev --no-watch
```

### Watch Additional Directories

```bash
npx discraft dev --watch-dir ./custom-modules
```

### Enable Verbose Logging

```bash
npx discraft dev --verbose
```

## Development Workflow

A typical development workflow with Discraft:

1. Start development mode:
   ```bash
   npx discraft dev
   ```

2. Edit your code (e.g., modify a command)

3. Save the file
   - Discraft detects the change
   - The file is recompiled
   - The bot is updated with the new code

4. Test the changes in Discord
   - Use the command or trigger the event you modified
   - See the changes take effect immediately

5. Repeat steps 2-4 until satisfied

6. When ready for production:
   ```bash
   npx discraft build
   ```

## Console Output

When running in development mode, you'll see output like:

```
[INFO] Starting Discraft in development mode...
[INFO] Compiling TypeScript...
[INFO] TypeScript compilation complete
[INFO] Watching for file changes...
[INFO] Bot is online and connected to Discord!
[INFO] Registered 5 commands to guild 123456789012345678
```

When you make changes to a file:

```
[INFO] File changed: commands/ping.ts
[INFO] Recompiling...
[INFO] Recompilation complete
[INFO] Bot updated successfully
[INFO] Command 'ping' updated
```

## Error Handling

When errors occur during development:

```
[ERROR] Failed to compile commands/ping.ts
[ERROR] TypeScript error: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'
[ERROR] at commands/ping.ts:15:10
```

Discraft provides detailed error messages and continues running when possible, allowing you to fix errors without restarting.

## Troubleshooting

### Command Not Registering

If your commands aren't registering:

```bash
# Ensure you've set the development guild ID
echo "DISCORD_GUILD_ID=your_guild_id" >> .env

# Restart development mode
npx discraft dev
```

### Hot Reloading Not Working

If changes aren't being detected:

```bash
# Try specifying the watch directory explicitly
npx discraft dev --watch-dir ./commands --watch-dir ./events

# Or restart with verbose logging
npx discraft dev --verbose
```

### TypeScript Errors

If you're getting TypeScript errors:

```bash
# Check your TypeScript configuration
cat tsconfig.json

# Make sure you have the correct types installed
npm install --save-dev @types/node discord.js
```
