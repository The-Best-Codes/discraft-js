# exec-build Command

The `discraft exec-build` command packages your Discord bot as a standalone executable that can run without Node.js installed, making deployment simpler on various platforms.

## Overview

The `exec-build` command:
- Compiles your bot code
- Bundles it with a Node.js runtime
- Creates a standalone executable for Windows, macOS, or Linux
- Includes all necessary dependencies

This is ideal for distributing your bot to users who may not have Node.js installed or for simplified deployment scenarios.

## Basic Usage

```bash
npx discraft exec-build
```

This builds your bot as a standalone executable for your current platform.

## Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--platform`, `-p` | Target platform (win, mac, linux) |
| `--arch`, `-a` | Target architecture (x64, arm64) |
| `--output`, `-o` | Output file name |
| `--compress`, `-c` | Compression level (0-9) |
| `--help`, `-h` | Display help information |

## Supported Platforms

The `exec-build` command can create executables for:

| Platform | Architecture | Output |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| Windows | x64 | `bot.exe` |
| macOS | x64, arm64 | `bot-macos` |
| Linux | x64, arm64 | `bot-linux` |

## Examples

### Build for Current Platform

```bash
npx discraft exec-build
```

### Build for Windows

```bash
npx discraft exec-build --platform win
```

### Build for macOS on Apple Silicon

```bash
npx discraft exec-build --platform mac --arch arm64
```

### Build for Linux with Custom Name

```bash
npx discraft exec-build --platform linux --output my-discord-bot
```

### Build with Maximum Compression

```bash
npx discraft exec-build --compress 9
```

## Build Process

When you run `discraft exec-build`, the following steps occur:

1. **Standard Build**: Your code is compiled like with `discraft build`
2. **Dependency Analysis**: All dependencies are analyzed and included
3. **Bundling**: Code is bundled into a single file
4. **Runtime Inclusion**: A Node.js runtime is included
5. **Executable Creation**: A standalone executable is created
6. **Compression**: The executable is compressed (optional)

## Environment Variables

For executable builds, environment variables need to be handled differently:

### Option 1: Embedded Environment Variables

You can embed environment variables in the executable:

```bash
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_token npx discraft exec-build
```

These variables will be baked into the executable.

### Option 2: External .env File

The executable will also look for a `.env` file in the same directory:

```
# .env file next to the executable
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_token
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
```

### Option 3: System Environment Variables

The executable will use system environment variables if available.

## Distribution

After building, you can distribute your bot as a single file:

1. **Windows**: `bot.exe`
2. **macOS**: `bot-macos`
3. **Linux**: `bot-linux`

Users only need to:
1. Download the executable
2. Create a `.env` file with their Discord token (or set environment variables)
3. Run the executable

## Running the Executable

### Windows

```
bot.exe
```

### macOS/Linux

```bash
chmod +x bot-macos  # Make executable
./bot-macos         # Run
```

## Security Considerations

When distributing executables:

1. **Token Security**: Don't embed sensitive tokens in distributed executables
2. **Code Exposure**: Be aware that your code can potentially be extracted
3. **Antivirus Alerts**: Some antivirus software may flag unknown executables

## Size Optimization

Executable size can be large due to the included Node.js runtime. To optimize:

1. **Remove unused dependencies**
2. **Use the compression option**:
   ```bash
   npx discraft exec-build --compress 9
   ```
3. **Consider platform-specific builds** instead of building for all platforms

## Limitations

Standalone executables have some limitations:

1. **Size**: Executables are larger than source code due to the included runtime
2. **Updates**: Users need to download a new executable for updates
3. **Platform-specific**: Each platform needs its own executable
4. **Native modules**: Some native Node.js modules may not work correctly

## Use Cases

Standalone executables are ideal for:

1. **Non-technical users**: Users who don't want to install Node.js
2. **Simplified deployment**: Single-file deployment to servers
3. **Desktop applications**: Bots that run alongside desktop applications
4. **Offline environments**: Environments without package managers
