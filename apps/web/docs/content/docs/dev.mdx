# `discraft dev`

Run your bot locally in development mode with hot reload. Discraft watches your files, rebuilds, and restarts the bot automatically so you can iterate quickly.

## Usage

```bash
# Using npx
npx discraft dev [options]

# If installed globally
discraft dev [options]
```

## Options

| Flag                      | Description                         | Default |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------- |
| `-b, --builder <builder>` | Builder to use: `esbuild` or `bun`. | auto    |
| `-r, --runner <runner>`   | Runner to use: `node` or `bun`.     | auto    |
| `-c, --clear-console`     | Clear the terminal on each rebuild. | false   |

## What It Does

- Watches your source files for changes.
- Rebuilds and restarts your bot automatically.
- Lets you use your preferred builder and runner.

## Example

```bash
# Use esbuild builder, Bun runner, and clear console
npx discraft dev -b esbuild -r bun -c
```

## Tips

- Use this during development for a fast feedback loop.
- If you see repeated restarts, check for errors in your code or dependencies.
